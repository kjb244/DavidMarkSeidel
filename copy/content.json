            "I struggle to find words depicting how perfect our ceremony, and just day in general, was. Everything came together as it should, and I believe it to be so because of Reverend Seidel’s leading role. His graciousness, leadership, positive attitude, and loving aura, smoothed the day over like a polished stone. Everyone went out of their way to compliment him, and they weren’t even aware of the phenomenal person he was behind the scenes. He is now my friend. He is now my family. I can not thank him enough. That being said, I highly recommend having him benefit any services he offers that you are in need of. Again to Reverend Seidel… Thank you. Thank you, thank you."
